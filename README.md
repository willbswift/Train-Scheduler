# Train-Scheduler

This is the ReadMe file for my “Ship Patrol” Train Scheduler.  It was the assignment for the 8th week at Web Developer Bootcamp.  

A program allows one to keep track of the estimated times of arrival of various starships on patrol.  It also allows the user to launch more starships to patrol around their starbase of choice.  The display is designed to mimic the computer interfaces used by Starfleet in the late 23rd Century. 

To deploy a new starship the user just has to input the name, home port, time of launch, and duration of patrol and hit the engage button.  I added a ETA Update button that refreshes the data.   

I’m particularly pleased with the “Current Stardate” readout in the upper header.  It displays the correct stardate for this year, day, and hour.  And, of course, I added a couple sound effects.    

To use it simply load the html file on your browser of choice.  Here’s the link...
